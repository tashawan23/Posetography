# Posetography
### Motivation
Many of us want to take nice photos to post on social media platforms or just for memories. Whether we want to take a nice picture on vacation or to show off our outfits, we often need the help of a passer-by or a friend. Have you ever been in the position where you are never satisfied with the photos that your friend takes of you? Maybe the angle is not flattering or the beautiful background is not captured or you just struggle to find a nice pose without seeming awkward.
### Aim
We hope to make the process of taking a nice photo easier and quicker through a single phone application.
### User Stories
1. As a social media user, I want to be able to take nice and unique post-worthy photos.
1. As a friend or family member taking a photo, I hope my photo-taking skills are up-to-standard. 
1. As a photo-taker or photographer, I want the process of photo-taking to be quick and stress-free.
1. As a photographer, I want to be able to plan and prepare for my photoshoots in advance.
### Scope of Project
The phone application provides pose guides and on the spot pose simulations for users to take photos within the application. The application also includes features like the weather feature that informs users of the current weather as well as sunrise and sunset timings on a certain day to help them plan their photoshoots ahead. Users can also create an account within Posetography to share their photos and poses as well as gain inspiration from friends and other users.
### Features
1. Weather

   * Track the sunrise and sunset timing of the day
1. Camera
   * Provides on-the-spot 2D pose simulation frames for user to take photos with under the normal camera setting
   * Poses are categorised into different categories for user convenience
   * Users can also access phone’s front camera and take pictures without pose frames
   * Users are able to access tips for each pose for more detailed explanation of the pose
1. Pose Guide

### How are we different from other similar applications?
* Unscripted
   * Similar to our application, Unscripted provides pose guides by categorising portraits from different photographers for their users to get inspiration. However, it does not provide on-the-spot pose guidelines within the camera, lacking real interaction with the poser and app user during the photo-taking process.
Our application solves this problem by implementing features that require access to the phone’s camera. By having rough outlines of poses and text guides on the camera’s preview screen, it allows users to be guided in the photo taking process. Pose simulations also provide users with guidelines on how to best position the camera and model in the frame.
